# Readme styles

Testing styles available in readme files on Github

## Inline and next line styles

Lets including the `ls` command in a sentence by wrapping with a single backtick.

Now, highlight a keyboard shortcut using the `kbd` html tag

<kbd>M-x destroy-all-things</kbd>

## Multiple line styles

Some clojure code wrapped with 3 backticks:

```
(defn clojure-is-awesome
  "Clojure is so wonderful"
  [arg]
  (str arg))
```

The same clojure code, this time specifying the language (this works with Hexo)

```clojure
(defn clojure-is-awesome
  "Clojure is so wonderful"
  [arg]
  (str arg))
```

# Other guides to Github styles
It would be nice to have all the styles on one page, until then there are more examples in the following pages:

* https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/
* https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/
* https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
